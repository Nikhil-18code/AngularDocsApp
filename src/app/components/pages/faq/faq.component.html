    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions about Angular</h1>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: What is Angular?</h2>
      <p>
        A: Angular is a platform and framework for building client-side applications using HTML and TypeScript. Developed and maintained by Google, it offers a comprehensive solution for building scalable web applications.
      </p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: What is the difference between Angular and AngularJS?</h2>
      <p>
        A: AngularJS is the original version (version 1.x) built with JavaScript and based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Angular (version 2 and above) is built with TypeScript, features a component-based architecture, and offers significant performance improvements along with modern tooling.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: What are Angular components?</h2>
      <p>
        A: Components are the fundamental building blocks of an Angular application. They encapsulate the data, logic, and presentation (HTML and CSS) for a specific view or part of the UI.

      <h2>Q: How do I install Angular?</h2>
      <p>
        A: To install Angular, first install Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version) and then install the Angular CLI globally by running:
      </p>
      <pre ngNonBindable>
        <code>npm install -g &#64;angular/cli</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        You can then create a new Angular project with:
      </p>
      <pre ngNonBindable>
        <code>ng new my-angular-app</code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: What is the Angular CLI?</h2>
      <p>
        A: The Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that helps you scaffold, build, test, and maintain Angular applications with ease.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: What is dependency injection in Angular?</h2>
      <p>
        A: Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to supply a component or service with its dependencies rather than having it create them. This promotes modularity, easier testing, and better code maintainability.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: What are Angular directives?</h2>
      <p>
        A: Directives are classes that add behavior to elements in your Angular applications. They can change the appearance or behavior of a DOM element. Examples include structural directives like <code ngNonBindable>&lt;*ngIf&gt;</code> and attribute directives like <code ngNonBindable>[ngClass]</code>.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: How does data binding work in Angular?</h2>
      <p>
        A: Angular supports several data binding techniques:
        <br /><strong>Interpolation:</strong> Displaying component data in the view using <code ngNonBindable>&#123;&#123;variable&#125;&#125;</code>
        <br /><strong>Property binding:</strong> Passing data from the component to the DOM.
        <br /><strong>Event binding:</strong> Listening to DOM events.
        <br /><strong>Two-way binding:</strong> Using <code>[(ngModel)]</code> for synchronizing data between the component and the view.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: What is RxJS and how is it used in Angular?</h2>
      <p>
        A: RxJS is a library for reactive programming using observables. Angular uses RxJS extensively for handling asynchronous operations, such as HTTP requests and event handling.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: What is Angular Router?</h2>
      <p>
        A: Angular Router is the module that provides navigation among views and components in an Angular application. It supports routing parameters, lazy loading, and route guards.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: How can I optimize the performance of my Angular application?</h2>
      <p>
        A: Performance can be optimized using techniques such as lazy loading, Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, OnPush change detection strategy, and reducing bundle sizes through tree shaking and code splitting.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: What are standalone components in Angular?</h2>
      <p>
        A: Standalone components are self-contained components that do not require an NgModule for declaration. They simplify the component architecture and improve modularity.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: How do I handle forms in Angular?</h2>
      <p>
        A: Angular offers two approaches for handling forms: Template-driven forms for simpler scenarios and Reactive forms for more complex and scalable form handling with robust validation.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: How do I test Angular applications?</h2>
      <p>
        A: Angular supports testing with tools like Jasmine and Karma for unit tests, and Protractor for end-to-end tests. The Angular CLI also provides commands to run tests and generate coverage reports.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: What is Angular Ivy?</h2>
      <p>
        A: Angular Ivy is the latest rendering engine introduced in Angular 9. It improves performance, reduces bundle sizes, and makes debugging easier. Ivy is now the default rendering engine in Angular.
      </p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: How can I secure my Angular application?</h2>
      <p>
        A: Security in Angular is achieved by following best practices such as using HTTPS, sanitizing inputs, implementing route guards for authentication, and leveraging Angular’s built-in protection against XSS and other vulnerabilities.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: How do I update or upgrade my Angular application?</h2>
      <p>
  A: Angular provides the ng update command to help update dependencies and migrate to newer versions. The official Angular Update Guide (available at update.angular.io) offers detailed instructions for upgrading.
      </p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Q: What is Angular Universal?</h2>
      <p>
        A: Angular Universal allows you to perform server-side rendering (SSR) of Angular applications. SSR can improve the performance, SEO, and initial load times of your web applications.
