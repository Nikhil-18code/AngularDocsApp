    <h2>What is Angular?</h2>
    <p>
      **Angular** is a **TypeScript-based front-end framework** developed and maintained by **Google**. It is designed
      for building scalable **single-page applications (SPAs)** with a structured architecture. Angular offers
      powerful tools like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>ðŸ”¹ **Component-based development** for modular and reusable UI elements</li>
      <li>ðŸ”¹ **Two-way data binding** for real-time synchronization between model and view</li>
      <li>ðŸ”¹ **Dependency Injection (DI)** to improve maintainability and testability</li>
      <li>ðŸ”¹ **Routing system** for seamless navigation within applications</li>
      <li>ðŸ”¹ **Directives and Pipes** to extend HTML functionality and manipulate data</li>
      <li>ðŸ”¹ **Built-in HTTP Client** for communicating with APIs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Angular is widely used by **enterprise applications, large-scale projects, and web platforms** due to
      its robust ecosystem and long-term support from Google.
